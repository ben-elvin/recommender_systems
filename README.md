# Welcome to the Recommender Systems Project Repository!

This project is a personal initiative designed to educate students about different types of recommender systems through practical, hands-on experience. By the end of this project, you will have built three distinct movie recommenders: a popularity recommender, a user-based recommender, and an item-based recommender, all using the MovieLens dataset. This project is a valuable resource for students at WBS Coding School, aiming to build a solid foundation in recommendation algorithms.

## About the Project

I developed the Recommender Systems Project specifically for students at WBS Coding School. This project serves as a comprehensive learning tool, encouraging you to explore, experiment, and develop your own recommendation systems. It is designed to impart practical knowledge and skills in building effective recommendation engines, similar to the recommendation rows seen on platforms like Netflix.

## Key Features

### Hands-On Notebooks

- **Interactive Notebooks**: This repository includes notebooks based on book recommendation data. These notebooks are designed to be run locally and provide a step-by-step guide to building different types of recommenders. You will then apply the knowledge gained to the MovieLens dataset to create movie recommenders.

### Types of Recommenders

- **Popularity Recommender**: Understand and implement a system that recommends items based on their overall popularity.
- **User-Based Recommender**: Learn how to build a system that recommends items by finding users with similar tastes and preferences.
- **Item-Based Recommender**: Develop a system that recommends items by finding items similar to those you have enjoyed in the past.

### Learning Objectives

- **Fundamentals of Recommender Systems**: Gain an understanding of the basic principles and algorithms behind recommender systems.
- **Practical Implementation**: Hands-on experience with implementing recommendation algorithms using Python and relevant libraries.
- **Data Handling and Processing**: Learn how to handle and process large datasets like the MovieLens dataset for use in recommendation systems.

## Learning Platform

The interactive notebooks in this repository are complemented by a comprehensive learning platform provided by WBS Coding School. This platform offers detailed resources and information on various topics relevant to recommender systems, such as collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and evaluation metrics. Please note that the learning platform itself is not included in this repository but is an essential companion to the hands-on exercises.

## Encouraging Innovation

At WBS Coding School, we encourage students to be active creators rather than passive learners. This project not only provides foundational knowledge and skills but also inspires you to innovate. Use the insights and techniques learned here to develop your own specialised recommendation systems tailored to unique datasets or specific industry needs.

Happy coding, and enjoy your journey into the exciting world of recommender systems!
